# CHRO+: Community Health Rewards for Optimal Longevity Outcomes

## Overview
CHRO+ is a decentralized health data marketplace built on Solana's DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) principles. Our platform incentivizes users to share their health data, collected via our proprietary XHRO wearable device, in exchange for CHRO token rewards. This data is then aggregated, anonymized, and made available to longevity researchers and health institutions, who can purchase access using Solana's native cryptocurrency, SOL.

Our mission is to accelerate breakthroughs in predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine by providing researchers with unprecedented access to diverse, real-world health data, while empowering users to control and benefit from their personal health information.

## Key Features
- **XHRO wearable device:** The world's smallest and most advanced health monitoring wearable, providing comprehensive, real-time health data.
- **Secure data tokenization:** User health data is tokenized as NFTs on the Solana blockchain, ensuring data privacy and user control.
- **CHRO token rewards:** Users earn CHRO tokens for sharing their health data, creating incentives for participation and data quality.
- **Data marketplace:** Researchers and health institutions can discover, purchase, and analyze relevant health datasets using SOL cryptocurrency.
- **Personalized health insights:** Users receive personalized health insights and recommendations based on their XHRO data and the broader health data ecosystem.

## Solana Hackathon Deliverables
During the Solana hackathon, our team achieved the following milestones:
1. Integrated XHRO wearable with Solana blockchain for secure data tokenization and transmission.
2. Developed smart contract architecture for CHRO token rewards and data access control.
3. Built user-facing web app for data contribution, token management, and personalized health insights.
4. Created researcher-facing web app for data discovery, acquisition, and analysis.
5. Conducted successful demo of end-to-end data flow from XHRO device to researcher data download.

## Future Roadmap
Looking ahead, we plan to:
- Launch beta platform with 1,000 users and 3 research partners in Q4 2023.
- Expand to support data from 5+ wearable devices and achieve 100,000 global users by 2024.
- Implement advanced privacy-preserving computation techniques for even more secure and granular data analysis.
- Foster a thriving ecosystem of third-party health apps and services built on CHRO plus data and insights.
